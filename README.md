# Model Predictive Control (MPC) in MATLAB

This repository contains the implementation of various **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** strategies using **MATLAB**.  
Each folder includes a specific MPC method designed for a particular control system, which is described in the corresponding `README.md` file inside each directory.

## 📁 Folder Overview

### 🔹 Dynamic Matrix Control (DMC)
Implementation of DMC strategy with tuning parameters and simulation results.

### 🔹 Generalized Predictive Control (GPC)
Includes the structure and design of a GPC controller for a given plant.

### 🔹 Model Algorithmic Control (MAC)
Provides simulation files and MATLAB codes for MAC controller performance.

### 🔹 Predictive Functional Control (PFC)
Contains the PFC controller design, structure, and simulation results.

## ℹ️ Note
Each controller is designed for a specific system, and detailed information about that system and the implementation method is provided inside the `README.md` file of each corresponding folder.
